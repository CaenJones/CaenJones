Hello! I am Caen Jones, just another stupid developer! I spend my time writing bad code, taking nature photography, and trying not to wreak my linux install.

My latest project's are: [thepurplebubble](https://github.com/thepurplebubble) and a terminal-based chatroom called [Devzat](https://github.com/quackduck/devzat).
